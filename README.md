# AlphaCalc
AlphaCalc is an application that takes verbal input in the form of text or audio, such as "multiply 4 by 3 subtracted by 2" and converts it into a mathematical expression which it evaluates.

Features
-------------
- comes with a memory that can be accessed or cleared at any time
- the way the calculator evaluates expressions is through presets, which can be added or removed at any time
- there are default presets in built, don't worry, you won't need to add "multiply" and "divide" from scratch, we've already done that, for an application that noone's probably going to use (_pain_)

Prerequisites
-------------
The machine must have MySQL installed. The password asked for by AlphaCalc is the MySQL password.

The following modules are to be installed:
- Tkinter
- mysql.connector
- Pyaudio
- playsound
- SpeechRecognition
- gTTS

If these modules are not already installed, just install them from the Command Prompt using:
```>pip install <module_name>```

Make sure the assets folder is copied correctly.

To myself (obviously, do you honestly think this ego doesn't need more pulls).

To Sreya, my partner in crime through this, and who has survived my spamming her with messages at 1 am about how we should use Helvetica over Garamond.

To @ParthJadav for inventing Python Drag and Drop and saving us from hair-pulling sessions with (horror of horrors) Tkinter. Instead we just spent 5 hours figuring out if the black we chose is _too_ dark.
